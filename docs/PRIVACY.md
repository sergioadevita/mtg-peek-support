# MTG Keep – Privacy Policy
_Last updated: 2025-08-26_

**Short version:** MTG Keep does not collect, transmit, or sell personal data. All settings stay in your browser.

---

## What the extension does
MTG Keep adds quality-of-life tools for Magic: The Gathering™ browsing (e.g., quick card peek and sorting) and shows an optional Ko‑fi **Donate** button that links to your Ko‑fi page.

## Data collection
- We **do not** collect, transmit, or sell personal or sensitive user data.
- We **do not** use analytics, trackers, beacons, or fingerprinting.
- We **do not** run remote code or load remotely hosted code.

## Permissions (transparency)
MTG Keep requests only the minimum required permissions. Typical permissions used:
- `storage` – save user preferences (stored locally or via Chrome sync storage).
- `activeTab` (or precise host permissions, if needed) – enable features only when you invoke the extension.
- Other permissions will only be requested if strictly necessary for visible features.

> If you change permissions in future versions, update this section and your Chrome Web Store privacy fields.

## How data is handled
- **Storage location:** Settings are stored in your browser. If Chrome Sync is enabled, preferences may sync across your devices via Google infrastructure.
- **No external transmission:** The extension does not send extension data to our servers.
- **No third‑party access:** No third parties receive extension data.

## Donations
The Ko‑fi button is a simple link to our Ko‑fi page. No payment details are handled by the extension. Any donation is processed entirely by Ko‑fi on their site.

## Children’s privacy
This extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to this policy
If we change what data we handle, we will update this policy and the Chrome Web Store privacy fields before releasing a new version.
